## Why Squabble was created
Squabble was created because we wanted an application which wouldn't track messages, use and store data, give advertisements or release subscription packages. Squabble is a hassle-free solution to global communication.

## Data & Privacy
Data is not stored, kept or used in anyway. You can rest assured knowing that your messages are between you and the recipient. We aim to have the highest privacy because we put the user first.
